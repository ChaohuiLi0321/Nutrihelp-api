Vulnerability_Tool_V2 - Quick setup

This document explains how to prepare the Python scanner environment used by the API.

Quick (one-command) setup

From the repository root run:

```bash
cd Vulnerability_Tool_V2
./setup_venv.sh
```

This will create `Vulnerability_Tool_V2/venv` and install packages from `requirements.txt`.

Manual steps (if you prefer):

```bash
cd Vulnerability_Tool_V2
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Notes for teammates

- The server (`npm start`) uses the venv at `Vulnerability_Tool_V2/venv/bin/python` as the primary Python executable for scanning. If that venv does not exist, the server will attempt to fallback to `python3` or `python` on the system (if available).
- If you run into permission issues when executing `./setup_venv.sh`, ensure the script is executable: `chmod +x setup_venv.sh`.
- After creating the venv you may run scans from Swagger UI (`/api-docs`) or by using the scanner CLI directly.
